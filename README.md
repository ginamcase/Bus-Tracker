This repository is a modification of an MITxPRO class assignment that shows an animation of the turn-by-turn route to bicycle from the Stata Building at MIT across the Charles River to the front of Fenway Park.

How to Operate: Load page, click button titled "Take Me Out to the Ballgame!". Markers will animate in the route from Stata Building to Fenway Park.

Future improvements: Even out the distance of markers. truly animate the route with a shaded/highlighted trail along the correct roads on the map. Leave the route highlighted during animation. Create an alert message when route is finished.
